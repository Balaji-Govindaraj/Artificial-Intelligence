Course on Artificial-Intelligence:

1. Linear and Polynomial regression code which is implemented end-to-end in numpy is trained and tested with simple data train_pr.csv and test_pr.csv

2. Logistic regressionw which is implemented end-to-end in numpy is trained and tested with simple data train_pr.csv and test_pr.csv

3. Reinforcement Learning model for cartpole game which is trying to learn from rewards+observation and then making its rewards maximum as the iteration proceeds.

4. Recurrent Networks Contents for static unrolling, dynamic unrolling, Variable input length based dynamic unrolling, MNIST data classification based on RNN.

5. Convolutional Neural Network which i have built from scratch which will be very much useful for beginners. CNN contains how to create dataset, load and transform data and then train with the network. Finally how to freeze the model, optimize for inference and quantize for low processing systems.

Still many more algorithms will be added soon.....
