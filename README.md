Course on Artificial-Intelligence:

1. Linear and Polynomial regression code which is implemented end-to-end in numpy is trained and tested with simple data train_pr.csv and test_pr.csv

2. Logistic regressionw which is implemented end-to-end in numpy is trained and tested with simple data train_pr.csv and test_pr.csv

3. Reinforcement Learning model for cartpole game which is trying to learn from rewards+observation and then making its rewards maximum as the iteration proceeds.


Still many more algorithms will be added soon.....
